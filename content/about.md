I am an Associate Professor of Environmental and Resource Economics in the Department of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education (AESE) at Penn State. I am co-funded by the Institutes of Energy and the Environment (IEE). My research centers on the interplay of economic choices and processes with patterns of land cover/land use over space and time, and the resultant effects on environmental conditions. The spatial configuration of land cover/land use is a major factor in leading contemporary environmental issues including climate change, habitat destruction, and water pollution. Land-use policies are therefore a key component of comprehensive environmental policies. Land-use policies require close attention to how economic decisions are driving, and being driven by, land cover/land use changes. My scholarship has addressed this interplay through projects focusing on three significant environmental topics: (1) open-space amenities; (2) landscape-related environmental risks such as floods, wildfires, and the spread of invasive species; and (3) water quality and biofuel production.
