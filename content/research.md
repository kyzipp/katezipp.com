# Research 

The spatial configuration of land cover/land use is of fundamental importance to environmental conditions, both amenities (e.g. scenic values, recreational benefits, housing quality), and dis-amenities (e.g. water pollution, habitat destruction through the spread of invasive species, natural disaster risks). My research develops models that integrate economic and natural process to explain economic-environmental interactions mediated dynamically through land cover/land use. Three specific areas of application that I have pursued in my research are: (1) open-space conservation, (2) landscape-related environmental risks such as floods, wildfires, and the spread of invasive species, and (3) agricultural cropping decisions and adoption best management practices.
